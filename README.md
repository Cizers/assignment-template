# Homework

## Directions

Copy the homeworks from the class repository to the `homework` folder, then do your works.

## Submission and Grading

Submit your completed code via `GitHub Classroom` prior to the deadline. Late submissions will not earn the full credits. You can submit as many times as you would like prior to the deadline.

# Project

## Directions

Do your project under the folder `project`. Though you can create or add any files in that folder, large files should not be included in the git repository. GitHub blocks pushes that exceed 100 MB. In case of the large files, use `Google Drive`.
